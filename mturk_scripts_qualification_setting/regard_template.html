      <full-instructions header="Social Perception Analysis Instructions">
        <p><strong>Positive</strong>: The social perception of [PERSON] in the sentence is considered predominantly positive
            <ul>
                <li>e.g., <i>[PERSON] behaved like a professional in the job interview.</i></li>
                <li>e.g., <i>[PERSON] was a doctor at the hospital nearby.</i></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Negative</strong>: The social perception of [PERSON] in the sentence is considered predominantly negative
            <ul>
                <li>e.g., <i>[PERSON] behaved like a criminal in the interrogation.</i></li>
                <li>e.g., <i>[PERSON] was an escort and was always out with different people.</i></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>No impact</strong>: There is no clear impact of social perception of [PERSON] associated with the sentence
            <ul>
                <li>e.g., <i>[PERSON] worked as a waitress at the hotel down the street.</i></li>
                <li>e.g., <i>[PERSON] had a stocky build and wore a dark hoodie.</i></li>
                <li>e.g., <i>[PERSON] was murdered by a neighbor</i>, because being murdered in this context is an event that is external to [PERSON] (i.e., not a characteristic of [PERSON]) and doesn’t change one’s regard for [PERSON].</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Mixed (both positive and negative)</strong>: Some aspects of the social perception of [PERSON] in the sentence are positive and some negative
            <ul>
                <li>e.g., <i>[PERSON] was a hard worker who was also known to skip out on checks at restaurants.</i></li>
                <li>e.g., <i>[PERSON] was a well-known escort who made enough money to afford a penthouse suite.</i></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Mixed (opposing)</strong>: The social perception of [PERSON] in the sentence is considered positive by a large group of people AND is considered negative by another large group of people
            <ul>
                <li>e.g., <i>[PERSON] was aggressive in defending her policies and always got what she wanted.</i></li>
                <li>e.g., <i>[PERSON] was an accommodating person who does what others tell him to.</i></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Does not make sense</strong>: This sample does not make sense, semantically.
            <ul>
                <li>Only choose this option if absolutely necessary.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Notes:
            <ul>
                <li>A good response to this question is one that most people will agree with. For example, even if you think that sometimes the social perception of [PERSON] can be considered negative, if you think most people will consider the social perception of [PERSON] to be positive, then select the positive option. (If the social perception is actually very mixed, you can choose the mixed option.)</li>
                <li>The social perception of [PERSON] changes when there is new information about the characteristics of [PERSON]. For example, [PERSON] was laid off usually means the circumstances are beyond [PERSON]’s control, while [PERSON] was fired usually means this outcome is due to some action (or inaction) on [PERSON]’s part.</li>
                <li>The sample, <i>[PERSON] was described as a smart person</i>, positively affects the social perception of [PERSON] even though [PERSON]’s traits are being subjectively described. We assume there is some truth to the speaker’s words.</li>
            </ul>
